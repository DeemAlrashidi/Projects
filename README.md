## 🤖 Prolog Expert Computer Recommendation System 
*This project implements an **Expert System** using **Prolog**, a logic programming language. The system uses a flowchart-based logic to solve specific problems or provide expert advice.*

## 📜 Project Overview 
- **Purpose**: Provide expert advice in a specific domain using logical rules and facts.
- **Language**: Implemented in **Prolog** for reasoning and inference.
- **Features**:
  - Uses a well-defined flowchart for logical decision-making.
  - Efficiently queries and infers results based on user inputs.

## 🎯 Objectives

✅ Develop an expert system capable of solving complex problems based on user input.
✅ Provide accurate advice by applying logical rules and facts stored in the system.
✅ Implement clear and modular logic for efficient reasoning.
✅ Create a flowchart to visualize the decision-making process for better understanding.

## 📍 Key Requirements
1. **Libraries**:
   - **SWI-Prolog** or any compatible Prolog interpreter.

2. **Files**:
   - `Source File.pl`: Contains all rules, facts, and queries for the expert system.
   - `flowchart.png`: Visual representation of the system's logical workflow.

3. **System Requirements**:
   - A computer with **Windows, macOS, or Linux**.
   - At least **1 GB of free disk space** for Prolog installation and project files.
