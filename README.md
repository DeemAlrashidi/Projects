## 🚗💨 Fuel Consumption Prediction Using Machine Learning: ⛽
*Second Place Winner At IAU's AI Project's Expo Competition*

## 📜 Project Overview 
- **Data Collection**: Utilized a dataset from Kaggle containing vehicle specifications and their corresponding fuel consumption metrics.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and prepared the data for modeling.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracted relevant features such as engine size, number of cylinders, and vehicle class.
- **Modeling**: Implemented and compared multiple machine learning models to predict fuel consumption.
*The Highest Accuracy this work obtained was by the SVM model which scored 99.3%*

## 🎯 Objectives
✅ Predict **fuel consumption** using machine learning models.  
✅ Evaluate key **factors** affecting fuel efficiency.  
✅ Optimize vehicle selection based on **CO₂ emissions**.  

## 📍 Key Requirements
*Libraries:*
   - TensorFlow
   - NumPy
   - Pandas
   - Sklearn
   - Matplotlib
