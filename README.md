# 📊 Algorithm Analysis: Finding the Kth Largest Element

*This project explores the efficiency of three sorting algorithms – **Heapsort, Selection Sort, and Quicksort** – in identifying the **kth largest element** within an array. The study provides both theoretical and empirical analyses, showcasing the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm through performance evaluation.*

## 📜 Project Overview

✅ Implementation of **Heapsort, Selection Sort, and Quicksort** for `kth` largest element retrieval.  
✅ **Empirical analysis** through execution time comparisons.  
✅ **Time and space complexity** evaluation of each algorithm.  
✅ **Graphical representation** of algorithmic performance under different conditions.  
✅ **Case studies** with varying array structures (random, sorted, reversed).  


## 🔬 Project Objectives

- Implement and evaluate **three sorting algorithms** for the `kth` largest element problem.
- Compare **time complexity and efficiency** across different array sizes.
- Identify the most efficient algorithm for varying conditions.
- Provide **visual performance analysis** using running time graphs.


### 🔧 Technologies Used
