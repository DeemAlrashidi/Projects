# 🌌 Galaxy Zoo Image Processing Project

This project implements **image processing and classification** techniques to analyze galaxy images. It involves preprocessing raw images, extracting features, and applying machine learning models to classify galaxy types.


## 📜 Overview

- **Purpose**: To classify galaxy images based on their morphological features.
- **Tools**: Utilizes Python libraries for image processing and machine learning.
- **Features**:
  - Image preprocessing to enhance data quality.
  - Feature extraction from galaxy images.
  - Classification of galaxies using machine learning models.

## 📊 Dataset Information (Kaggle)
 - Source: Galaxy Zoo image dataset (compressed in Data.zip).
 - Format: High-resolution images of galaxies.
 - Purpose: Classification of galaxies based on their morphological characteristics.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Process and clean raw galaxy images for analysis.
- Extract relevant features for morphological classification.
- Implement machine learning models to classify galaxy types accurately.
- Visualize the results of image processing and model predictions.
